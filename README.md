# Monthly Article Traffic for Rare Disease Pages on Wikipedia

## Project Goal

According to the homework instructions, "the goal of this project is to collect, analyze, and publish a dataset of monthly article traffic for a subset of rare disease-related Wikipedia pages from July 2015 through September 2024. This project follows best practices for reproducible research, and the data is made available for further analysis and study.

## Source Citation

The data are a specified subset of Wikipedia article pages in .csv format. According to the homework instructions, "this is a subset of the English Wikipedia that represents a large number of articles related to rare diseases. This list of pages was collected by using a database of rare diseases maintained by the National Organization for Rare Diseases (NORD) and matching them to Wikipedia articles that are either about a rare disease or have a section that mentions a rare disease.""

## License of Source Data

The dataset is constructed using data from the Wikimedia Foundation's Pageviews API, which is licensed under [Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en).

### Example Code

This example illustrates how to access page view data using the [Wikimedia REST API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_REST_API). This example shows how to request monthly counts of page views for one specific article. The API documentation, [pageviews/per-article](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Pageviews%20data), covers additional details that may be helpful when trying to use or understand this example.

## Data Files and Schema

The following data files are generated by the scripts in this repository:

1.  **rare-disease_monthly_mobile_201507-202409.json**: A JSON file containing the monthly mobile access data for each article.
    -   **Schema**: { ARTICLE TITLE: [ { "project": STRING, "article": STRING, "granularity": STRING, "timestamp": YYYYMMDDSS date, "agent": STRING, "views": INT }, ... ] }
2.  **rare-disease_monthly_desktop_201507-202409.json**: A JSON file containing the monthly desktop access data for each article.
    -   **Schema**: { ARTICLE TITLE: [ { "project": STRING, "article": STRING, "granularity": STRING, "timestamp": YYYYMMDDSS date, "agent": STRING, "views": INT }, ... ] } containing the cumulative pageviews with mobile and desktop access for each article.
3.  **rare-disease_monthly_cumulative_201507-202409.json**: A JSON file containing the monthly cumulative access data for each article.
    -   **Schema**: { ARTICLE TITLE: [ { "project": STRING, "article": STRING, "granularity": STRING, "timestamp": YYYYMMDDSS date, "agent": STRING, "views": INT }, ... ] } The cumulative number of pageviews for that article in that month (mobile + desktop).

## Known Issues and Considerations

-   Some articles may have limited data due to low pageviews or limited presence during the collection period.
-   Some visualization rankings may not make it clear that some articles were tied (particularly in the top 10 least documented articles graph)
-   The data only includes access types from mobile and desktop, but wikipedia is definitely accessible via other methods (gaming consoles, smart appliances, etc.)
-   Data quality may vary depending due to Wikimedia API's historical logs.

## Reproducibility and Citation

This homework follows reproducible research practices. Portions of the code has been text-generated by ChatGPT, OpenAI, 7 Oct. 2024. These portions are noted in the markdown of the code preceding them, including the prompt, and are wrapped in a function to contain them. Note that all portions of text-generated code have been edited from their original versions for logic, clarity, and usability.

If you use this data or code, please provide proper credit to the Wikimedia Foundation as the source of the data and the example notebook as a source of the software.
